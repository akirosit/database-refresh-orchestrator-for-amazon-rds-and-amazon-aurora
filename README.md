## Database refresh orchestrator for Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora

This repository contains the resources required to build the solution described in the AWS Database Blog post https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-systems-manager-database-voice-commands/edit/master/README.md.
The package **awssoldb-orchestrator-pkg-cloudformation** represents the solution (CloudFormation templates, Lambda function's code and sample sql-scripts).
The package **awssoldb-orchestrator-launch.zip** contains the code to launch (manually, in this demo) the orchestrator.
